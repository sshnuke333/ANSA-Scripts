ANSA Scripts
========
Written in python and for specific requirements, these scripts will help user
to automate work in ANSA.

This Repo includes two scripts:

*Free_Edge.py* - Creates a SET of shell elements having two or more Free edges.

*Master_slave.py* - Creates a table of master and slave PIDs based on user
selection. Makes it easy to copy and paste master and corresponding slave PIDs
into other software (Hypermesh etc.).

## Installation
Requires no installation. Load the scripts using script manager available
in ANSA and user buttons with script names will be generated.

## Limiataions
These scripts work on first order shell elements only (Quads and Trias).
